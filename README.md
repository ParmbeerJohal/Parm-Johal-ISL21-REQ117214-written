## Winter Supplement Rules Engine

The Winter Supplement Rules Engine is a Python application designed to calculate eligibility and benefit amounts for families. It uses MQTT messaging to interact with the MQTT broker hosted at test.mosquitto.org and includes a rules engine for processing input data.

### Setting Up a Development Environment

#### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.13.0+**: Ensure you have Python installed.
2. **Pip**: Python's package manager.
3. **MQTT Broker**: The app uses the public MQTT broker `test.mosquitto.org`.
4. **Docker (optional)**: Used for containerizing the app and, in this case, make the setup process easier for running/testing.

#### Steps (with Docker)
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ParmbeerJohal/Parm-Johal-ISL21-REQ117214-written.git
   cd Parm-Johal-ISL21-REQ117214-written
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t winter-supplement-rules-engine-app .
   ```

#### Steps (without Docker)
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ParmbeerJohal/Parm-Johal-ISL21-REQ117214-written.git
   cd Parm-Johal-ISL21-REQ117214-written
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
   ```

---

### Running the Application Locally

#### Start the Application (with Docker)
1. Run the Docker container with the topic id argument:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it winter-supplement-rules-engine-app --topic-id <your-topic-id>
   ```
   Replace `<your-topic-id>` with the topic ID generated by the Winter Supplement web app.

2. Example:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it winter-supplement-rules-engine-app --topic-id 5123fd09-c862-4595-80e5-4b595fbff11c
   ```

3. The application will:
   - Subscribe to the input topic: `BRE/calculateWinterSupplementInput/<your-topic-id>`.
   - Publish results to the output topic: `BRE/calculateWinterSupplementOutput/<your-topic-id>`.

#### Start the Application (without Docker)
1. Run the application with a specified MQTT topic ID:
   ```bash
   python main.py --topic-id <your-topic-id>
   ```
   Replace `<your-topic-id>` with the topic ID generated by the Winter Supplement web app.

2. Example:
   ```bash
   python main.py --topic-id 5123fd09-c862-4595-80e5-4b595fbff11c
   ```

3. The application will:
   - Subscribe to the input topic: `BRE/calculateWinterSupplementInput/<your-topic-id>`.
   - Publish results to the output topic: `BRE/calculateWinterSupplementOutput/<your-topic-id>`.

### Updating the MQTT Topic ID

If the topic ID changes during testing or runtime:
1. Gracefully end the app with `ctrl + c`
2. rerun the above command with the new topic ID

---

### Running Unit Tests

#### Test Overview
The application includes unit tests for:
- The **Rules Engine** (`rules_engine.py`).
- The **MQTT Client** (`mqtt_client.py`).

#### Running Tests
1. Ensure you are in the virtual environment.
2. Use the following command to run all tests:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

3. Expected output:
   - A report of passing and failing tests.

#### Example:
```bash
============================= test session starts ==============================
collected 10 items                                                              

tests/test_mqtt_client.py .                                            [ 10%]
tests/test_rules_engine.py .........                                   [100%]

============================== 10 passed in 0.21s ===============================
```
